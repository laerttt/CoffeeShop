COFFEE SHOP FRANCHISE PROJECT

Why a coffee shop system?
In today's world, everything is digitally connected. Efficient communication and management in business is extremely important
and technology helps us be as efficient as possible. The core idea behind the project is simple to understand: it is a project 
that is designed to help a coffee shop franchise gather and sort data, manage employees and incentivize customers to use the 
service. Although the concept behind the project is simple, effective implementation of the idea may prove to be tricky, as 
there are multiple layers and levels to the project that must be taken into consideration, such as a multi-leveled user system,
online orders, a fully functional database for each store, a central database for evaluating store and item performances, etc.
Simply put, the project aims to create a system that is essential and efficient for the target, the idea behind the project is
easy to understand and there are many intricacies that are present in setting up such a system.


Core Idea:
The main and most important idea behind the project is the customer purchasing system. Customers must be able to place online orders
and in-person orders in their name. This will be achieved through a web app that allows users to create their own customer accounts
using their cellphone numbers, each account must have its own details regarding past purchases and location so that frequent customers
may be offered coupons and news regarding the store closest to them. There must also be an employee user level that allows for managing
orders in the specific store that the employee is registered to. In order to make in-person ordering effective, a special menu
that can be accessed via QR code is required. For online ordering to be effective, there must also be a delivery user level that
can receive orders and mark them as complete upon delivery.


Functionalities:
Everything in the project is reliant on a web application. The functionalities of the application include:
- User-friendly website that shows relevant information to visitors (Store locations, available items, about the franchise)
- A multi-level user system with 5 different user roles, those being: customer, delivery, store worker, manager and admin.
- Point system for customers that allow for special offers for various items.
- Recording data for each individual store using a database.
- Recording data for overall item performance and performance across different stores.
- Central database with information on each store location.
- Online order placement by customers using the web app.
- In-person order placement using a special menu that can be accessed via QR code.
